Hello world!

This is an information file used by bar to print useful stuff while your data
is copied.  This line should be the last line shown for now.

Hello again!

this is yet another entry in the info file.

If you want to create your own information file, simply pass

  --info-file <filename>

to bar on the command line.  Inside your information file, have a few little
tidbits of information separated by lines that contain only three '@'
characters.  (The "@@@" string, on a line by itself, with no leading or
trailing characters, is a delimiter that bar looks for when printing
information.  It tells bar that the end of the current tidbit of information
has been reached, and the text that follows is the begining of the next
information tidbit.)

And that's it!

Well, not quite.  Since now bar needs to know the height of the terminal we
well as the width, there are some height-specific command line and rc-file
options that have been added.  In addition to -sw and --screen-width, there
are now corresponding -sh and --screen-height command line and rc-file
options.

...And now that's it.  Enjoy the rest of your day.
